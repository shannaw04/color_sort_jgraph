 * This function reads a string containing data on the number of colors,

 * as well as the initial color value for each block in the bottles for 
 * the level's starting state. It saves these values to the ColorSort 
 * object's data members. 
 * It also saves the level's initial state so the player can reset the
 * level if they wish.
 * 
 * Parameters: const string &level. This string needs to be in the format: 
 *   num_bottles, num_blocks, then the color value for each bottle's 
 *   blocks, starting with the 1st bottle's top block and ending with the 
 *   last bottle's bottom block, each value separated with a space. 
 * Returns: true if the level was loaded sucessfully.

/* make_move
 * This function determines the number of blocks of color to be 
 * moved from the "from" bottle to the "to" bottle. 
 * 
 * It calls bottles_valid to make sure bottle numbers are valid.
 * Then it finds the top color in the "from" bottle and counts the 
 * number of consecutive blocks of that color. 
 * Then it finds the top color in the "to" bottle and counts the 
 * number of empty blocks available. 
 * It then calls transfer_blocks to move the blocks from "from" 
 * to "to", with blocks_to_move being either the number of 
 * consecutive blocks in "from" or number of empty blocks in "to", 
 * whichever is smaller. 
 * Checks if "to" bottle is complete after move, and if so, updates
 * count of completed bottles.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   int from: Number of bottle moving from. 
 *   int to: Number of bottle moving to. 
 *   These are the numbers printed above the bottles in the game
 * Returns: 
 *   true if the move can be made
 *   false if the move can't be made:
 *     If the "from" bottle is empty
 *     If the "to" bottle is full
 *     If the top colors in the bottles don't match
