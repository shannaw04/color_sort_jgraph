 * Color Sort: ColorSort.hpp
 * Shanna Wallace
 * Updated: 2/10/2024
 * 
 * This file contains the declaration for class ColorSort, used by 
 * the Color Sort game. 
 * 
 * Use load_level(string level) to load the level's data. It needs to
 * be in the format: 
 *   num_colors, num_blocks, num_bottles each separated by a 
 *   space, then the color value (int) for each bottle's blocks, 
 *   starting with the 1st bottle's top block and ending with the last 
 *   bottle's bottom block, each separated with a space.
 *   Indicate empty blocks with the 0 intacter.
 * 
 * print_bottles() will print the game state to stdout with ASCII art.
 *  
 * You can use print_msg_file(string filename) to load and display
 * messages from a file in the game, such as a welcome message or 
 * gameplay instructions.
 * 
 * reset_level() will reset the level to its initial state. 
 * 
 * make_move(int from, int to) will move blocks of color from 
 * the "from" bottle to the "to" bottle. Use the number printed
 * above the bottle. make_move will call bottles_valid to error
 * check the from and to values.
 * 
 * The game keeps track of the number of bottles that have been 
 * sorted, and when this number of completed_bottles equals
 * the number of colors in the level, level_complete() will return 
 * true.
