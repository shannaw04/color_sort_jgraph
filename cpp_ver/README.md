# Color Sort!

This is a C++ implementation of a Color Sort game.<br>

**This version of the game only prints in 1 color, so it will use letters instead of colors.**

## What is Color Sort?
Color Sort is a puzzle game that starts with blocks of various colors shuffled up in bottles. You are given 1 empty bottle if there are 2 or 3 colors to be sorted and 2 empty bottles if there are 4+ colors.<br>

The objective of the game is to sort all of the colors so that all blocks of the same color are in the same bottle.

## How to play Color Sort
You can move the top-most color from one bottle to another bottle if: 
* The source bottle is not empty
* The destination bottle is empty 
* The destination bottle is not empty, but has empty space available and the top color matches the top color in the source bottle.
* Neither bottle has already been sorted (full of blocks of only one color) <br>

Once all colors have been sorted so that all blocks of the same color are in the same bottle, the level is complete! 

### Example Game:
Here's an example of a level with 2 colors (letters for this version). Your goal is to get all of the As in one bottle and all of the Bs in another:<br>
![initial state](instr_pics/initial.png)
<br>To start, you can either move the top B from bottle 1 to bottle 3, or the top two As from bottle 2 to bottle 3. 
To move the top As from bottle 2 to bottle 3, we enter "2 3":<br>
ENTER MOVE: 2 3<br>
![after 1st move](instr_pics/2.png) <br>

Now, the only available move is transferring the top B in bottle 1 to bottle 2:<br>
ENTER MOVE: 1 2<br>

![after 2nd move](instr_pics/3.png)<br>
You can move the top A in bottle 1 to bottle 3, then the B in bottle 1 to bottle 2, then the last A in bottle 1 to bottle 3 to complete the level:<br>

## How to Run the Game:
#### Create Executables
There is a makefile included that compiles the executables on Hydra, so just enter "make" in the cpp_ver directory to create your executables. They will be placed in the "bin" directory. 

#### Start the Game
To start the Color Sort game, enter the following command from your cpp_ver directory:<br>
bin/play input_file <br>
bin/play takes the name of an input_file containing data for a set of Color Sort levels as a command line argument. <br>
It will load the game data and display the game to stdout and take user input from stdin. <br>
After completing a level, it will load the next level in the file, until the user quits the game or all levels in the file have been completed. 

#### Where to Find Game Input Files:
Input files containing multiple levels per file are in the games directory. The command <br>
bin/play games/1per.txt will start a game with 1 level per number of colors, starting at 2 and going up to 12. <br>
The level_files directory contains directories with individual files for each level. 

## Game Input Files
#### Level Data String:
Color Sort will read level data from a one-line string in the following format: <br>
num_colors num_blocks num_bottles bottles[0] bottles[1] ... bottles[last] <br>
where num_colors is the number of colors in the level,
num_blocks is the number of blocks of color per bottle, and 
num_bottles is the number of bottles in the level. <br>
It reads the color value (letter) for each block in the bottles, starting with the top-most block in the 1st bottle and ending with the bottom-most block in the last bottle. <br>
For example, the level data string: <br> 
2 4 3 B A B A A A B B - - - -  <br>
will give the following output:<br>
![initial state](instr_pics/initial.png)

#### Files Containing Multiple Levels:
You may put multiple levels in one file with one level's data per line. bin/play will load levels from  this file one line at a time, starting with the first line. 


## Creating Levels
#### Create 1 Level
bin/create1 will create 1 Color Sort level. <br>
It reads the number of colors for the level to contain from stdin, then outputs the level's data in the format bin/play will read to stdout.


#### Create a Set of Levels
bin/create_set will create a set of levels for Color Sort.

It takes the following command line arguments:<br>
bin/create_set <game_name> <output_type> <input_file><br>

It generates the number and type of levels requested in <input_file>. You can output all of the levels' data to one file (one level per line), or create an individual file for each level, or both. <br>
game_name: The name you'd like to give this set of levels.<br>

output_type: <br>
 * f: Put all level data in one file, one level per line. It will be put in the games directory with name game_name.txt
 * d: Create a file for each individual level. It will put the files in the level_files directory, in a subdirectory named game_name. The level files will be named C_L.txt, where C is the number of colors in the level, and L is the number of the file with that number of colors.
 * b: Create both one file with all level data, plus individual files for each level.<br>
 
 input_file: Name of a file containing the instructions for the number of levels to create. 

#### Level Creation Instruction File
This is the input_file provided to bin/gen_levels.
This file should contain the number of colors for the levels, followed by a space, then the number of levels you'd like to create with that number of colors, followed by a space or newline. <br>
For example, if you want to create 5 levels with 2 colors and 10 levels with 3 colors,your input_file would need to be: <br>
 2 5 <br>
 3 10
